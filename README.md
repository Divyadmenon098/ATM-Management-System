# ATM-Management-System #

The ATM Management System is a Python project that simulates real-world ATM functionalities. Designed with a focus on simplicity, security, and user-friendliness, the system provides core ATM features, such as secure user authentication, account management, and transaction processing.

# Steps followed: #

Define Project: Identified features like authentication, transactions, and account management.

Design Architecture: Plan core functionalities and a modular structure.

Implement Authentication: Develop PIN-based login using hashed PINs (Python library).

Account Management: Add account creation, PIN change, and balance updates.

Perform Transactions: Implement deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry features.

Integrate Security: Hash PINs and include session timeout functionality.

Implement loop for menu-dirven interface: Create a menu-driven interface for smooth navigation.

# Future Scope: #

The future scope includes integrating a real database for secure storage and transaction history like importing sqlite3, implementing advanced security features like multi-factor authentication and encryption like otp, and enabling fund transfers and scheduled payments. The system can evolve with a graphical user interface (GUI) or web-based access, providing cross-platform usability. Incorporating AI and machine learning could enhance fraud detection and personalized financial insights. Additionally, scalability through cloud deployment and compliance with financial regulations would make the system suitable for real-world applications.
